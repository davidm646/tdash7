# Vercel Environment Variables Setup

When deploying this app to Vercel, you need to configure the following Environment Variables in the "Settings" > "Environment Variables" section of your project.

## 1. Tesla Fleet API Keys
These are used by the backend (api/ folder) to securely communicate with Tesla.

TESLA_ACCESS_TOKEN
  - Value: Your Tesla Access Token (Bearer Token).
  - Scope: Server-side only (Backend).
  - Note: If you are using the full OAuth flow, you would also need TESLA_CLIENT_ID and TESLA_CLIENT_SECRET here.

## 2. Gemini AI Keys
Used by the backend to perform vehicle diagnostics.

API_KEY
  - Value: Your Google Gemini API Key.
  - Scope: Server-side only (Backend).

## 3. Frontend Variables (Optional)
If you add a "Login with Tesla" button in the future that redirects the user's browser, you would add:

VITE_TESLA_CLIENT_ID
  - Value: Your Tesla Client ID.
  - Scope: Client-side (Frontend).
  - Note: React (Vite) requires variables to start with "VITE_" to be exposed to the browser. This is equivalent to "NEXT_PUBLIC_" in Next.js.

------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT:
Never put your Client Secret or Access Token in a VITE_ variable.
